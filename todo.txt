HTTP
====

 - (partially done) add limits for header line length, body size, number of headers or request size and request time to avoid DoS
 - defer writing the header of server responses to the second written chunk in case of using bodyWriter() - if only one chunk is ever written, write non-chunked instead
 - implement generators for http.rest to generate a JavaScript client and "documentation" with all possible requests.

TCP
===

 - Find out what makes the libevent event loop continue to run after all connections have been disconnected
 - Add a DoS barrier that closes old connections in case of high connection counts

GENERAL
=======

 - Asynchronous file I/O
 - Load balancer with support for seemless recompile
 - Use the event_set_*_callback functions to log libevent messages
 - Analyze all code for memory leaks (e.g. SSLContext)
 - Add template arguments to API docs
 - HTTP server comparison to nginx
 - Mention the API used for Diet templates on the /templates page
 - Implement a soft-shutdown in case of catching an Error (in conjunction with vibedist)
 - Add support for an entry "lowerPriviledges" to package.json which will use the system's 'vibe' user for priviledge lowering
 - Document the different -version specifiers that are possible
 - Add code to generate a static version of vibed.org suitable for inclusion as docs in the download package

DIET TEMPLATES
==============

 - comments
 - block default contents
 
MARKDOWN FILTER
===============

 - see markdown.d
 - add SmartyPants support

PACKAGE MANAGER
===============

 - allow the specification of optional dependencies (the user will just get a message that its possible to extend a package by installing the dependency)
 - implement "vibe init" to create a new vibe application skeleton ("vibe init" is in the current dir - warn if not empty!, and "vibe init xx" creates a new dir xx)
 - implement outputting of a generated vpm_versions.d module that contains the version of each installed package
 - package signing
