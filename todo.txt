HTTP
====

 - (partially done) add limits for header line length, body size, number of headers or request size and request time to avoid DoS
 - defer writing the header of server responses to the second written chunk in case of using bodyWriter() - if only one chunk is ever written, write non-chunked instead
 - ETag/If-None-Match
 - implement maxRequestTime

TCP
===

 - Active TCP connections are not disconnected and the event loop keeps running
 - Add a DoS barrier that closes old connections in case of high connection counts

GENERAL
=======

 - Asynchronous file I/O
 - Load balancer with support for seemless recompile
 - Use the event_set_*_callback functions to log libevent messages
 - Analyze all code for memory leaks (e.g. SSLContext)
 - Add template arguments to API docs
 - UTF files including byte order mark cannot be parsed, currently
 - Benchmark
 - HTTP server comparison to nginx
