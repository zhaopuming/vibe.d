HTTP
====

 - defer writing the header of server responses to the second written chunk in case of using bodyWriter() - if only one chunk is ever written, write non-chunked instead
 - implement generators for http.rest to generate a JavaScript client and "documentation" with all possible requests.

TCP
===

 - Find out what makes the libevent event loop continue to run after all connections have been disconnected
 - Add a DoS barrier that closes old connections in case of high connection counts (e.g. Slowloris attack)

GENERAL
=======

 - Asynchronous file I/O (already works for Win32)
 - Load balancer with support for seemless recompile (vibedist)
 - Use the event_set_*_callback functions to log libevent messages
 - Analyze all code for memory leaks (e.g. SSLContext)
 - HTTP server comparison to nginx
 - Mention the API used for Diet templates on the /templates page
 - Implement a soft-shutdown in case of catching an Error (in conjunction with vibedist)
 - Add support for an entry "lowerPriviledges" to package.json which will use the system's 'vibe' user for priviledge lowering
 - Document the different -version specifiers that are possible
 - See why find([""]) and find(Bson()) resets the connection and maybe detect their use before sending the command to the server
 - Add proper documentation for types supported by the REST interface generator

DIET TEMPLATES
==============

 - block comments
 - block default contents
 
MARKDOWN FILTER
===============

 - see markdown.d
 - add SmartyPants support

PACKAGE MANAGER
===============

 - allow the specification of optional dependencies (the user will just get a message that its possible to extend a package by installing the dependency)
 - implement outputting of a generated vpm_versions.d module that contains the version of each installed package
 - package signing
