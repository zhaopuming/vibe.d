v0.7.6 - 2012-07-15
-------------------

### Features and improvements ###
 
 - A good amount of performance tuning of the HTTP server
 - Implemented vibe.core.core.yield(); this can be used to break up long computations into smaller parts to reduce latency for other tasks
 - Added setup-linux.sh and setup-mac.sh scripts that set a symlink in /usr/bin and a config file in /etc/vibe (Thanks to Jordi Sayol)
 - Installed VPM modules are now passed as version identifiers "VPM_package_xyz" to the application to allow for optional features
 - Improved serialization of structs/classes to Json/Bson - properties are now serialized and all non-field/property members are now ignored
 - Added directory handling functions to vibe.core.file (not using asynchronous operations, yet)
 - Improved the vibe shell script's compatibility

### Bug fixes ###
 
 - Fixed TcpConnection.close() for the libevent driver - this caused hanging page loads in some browsers
 - Fixed MongoDB connection handling to avoid secondary assertions being triggered in case of exceptions during the communication
 - Fixed JSON (de)serialization of structs and classes (member names were wrong)
 - Fixed (filter)urlEncode for character values < 0x10

 
v0.7.5 - 2012-06-05
-------------------

 - Restructured the examples - each example is now a regular vibe.d application (also fixes compilation using run_example)
 - The REST interface generator now supports sub interfaces which are mapped to sub paths in the URL
 - Added InjectedParams!() to access parameters injected using inject!()
 - The vibe script and VPM now do not write to the application directory anymore if not necessary
 - Implement more robust type handling in the REST client generator
 - Fixed a possible exception in ZlibInputStream at the end of the stream


v0.7.4 - 2012-06-03
-------------------

 - Added support for multipart/form-data and file uploads
 - Rewrote the Markdown parser - it now does not emit paragraphs inside list elements if no blank lines are present and handles markdown nested in quotes properly
 - The SMTP client supports STARTTLS and PLAIN/LOGIN authentication
 - The Diet parser now supports generic :filters using registerDietTextFilter() - :css, :javascript and :markdown are already built-in
 - VPM now can automatically updates dependencies and does not query the registry at every run anymore
 - Added vibe.templ.utils.inject which allows to flexibly stack together request processors and inject variables into the final HTML template (thanks to simendsjo for the kick-off implementation)
 - Removed InputStream.readAll() and readLine() and replaced them by UFCS-able global functions + added readUntil()
 - Added ConnectionPool to generically manage reuse of persistent connections (e.g. for databases)
 - The HttpClient (and thus the reverse proxy) now uses a connection pool to avoid continuous reconnects
 - On *nix now uses pkg-config to find linker dependencies if possible (dawgfoto)
 - The static HTTP file server now resolves paths with '.' and '..' instead of simply refusing them
 - Implemented handling of HttpServerSettings.maxRequestTime
 - Added setLogFile()
 - The vibe.cmd script now works with paths containing spaces
 - Libevent2TcpConnection now enforces proper use of acquire()/release()
 - Improved stability in conjunction with TCP connections
